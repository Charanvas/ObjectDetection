# 🧠 Smart Interaction using Computer Vision

A lightweight, real-time object detection system that uses YOLOv8 and OpenCV to enable intelligent interactions in physical spaces — optimized for low-resource environments such as laptops, Raspberry Pi, and edge devices.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

Use computer vision to detect objects in real-world environments (e.g., Airbnb rooms) and trigger AI-driven interactions based on what's detected — making spaces more intelligent and responsive.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Real-time object detection using webcam
- ⚡ Powered by YOLOv8 (nano version for efficiency)
- 🤖 AI-triggered interactions (e.g., reminders, greetings)
- 🧩 Ready for API/UI integration (Flask-based)
- 🧠 Custom model support for domain-specific applications
